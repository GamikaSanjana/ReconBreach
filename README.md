# ReconBreach: AI-Based Penetration Testing Tool

**ReconBreach** is an AI-powered tool that automates the entire penetration testing lifecycle, from reconnaissance to exploitation and post-exploitation. This tool is designed to streamline penetration testing by using machine learning to predict vulnerable areas and generate smart payloads based on system responses.

## Features

- **Automated Penetration Test Flow**: Upload a target, and the tool starts an automated attack sequence, testing for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- **Multi-Vector Attack Simulation**: Simultaneously tests for vulnerabilities across web, mobile, and network surfaces.
- **AI-Based Reconnaissance**: Automates scanning of websites, APIs, and IoT devices while categorizing information like open ports, software versions, and SSL configurations.
- **AI Payload Generation**: Uses machine learning models to generate optimized exploit payloads.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Attempts to escalate privileges, pivot through networks, and maintain persistence.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Generates detailed reports with vulnerability severity, exploitability, and suggested mitigation actions.
