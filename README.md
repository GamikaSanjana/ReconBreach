     - Upload a target and initiate a multi-layered attack sequence, including:
       - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
       - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
       - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
       - **Command Injection**
       - **Directory Traversal**
       - **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
       - **Server Misconfigurations**
     - Automatically discovers critical weaknesses, simulating the methods of elite penetration testers.

### 2. **Multi-Vector Attack Simulation**
   - **ReconBreach** conducts parallel attacks across multiple attack surfaces:
     - **Web Applications**
     - **Mobile Applications (iOS, Android)**
     - **Network Infrastructure**
   - Each attack is carefully simulated to cover all possible attack vectors, mimicking sophisticated, multi-faceted penetration attempts designed to uncover every weak point.

### 3. **AI-Powered Reconnaissance**
   - Utilizing **AI and machine learning**, **ReconBreach** intelligently gathers reconnaissance data:
     - **Websites**: Scans for open ports, services, and SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.
     - **APIs**: Detects undocumented endpoints and hidden security gaps.
     - **IoT Devices**: Uncovers potential attack vectors in connected devices.
   - AI analyzes collected data to predict likely weak spots, optimizing attack strategies for the most exploitable vulnerabilities.

### 4. **AI-Based Payload Generation**
   - **ReconBreach** dynamically generates intelligent **payloads** based on real-time reconnaissance:
     - **Predictive Vulnerability Targeting**: Uses AI to predict attack vectors and generate the most efficient payloads.
     - **Payload Types**: Supports **SQLi**, **XSS**, **CSRF**, **Command Injections**, and more.
     - Optimizes payload effectiveness, reducing false positives and maximizing exploitation success rates.

### 5. **Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement**
   - After successful exploitation, **ReconBreach** pushes forward:
     - **Privilege Escalation**: Attempts to gain higher-level access within the compromised environment.
     - **Pivoting**: Facilitates lateral movement across the network to compromise additional systems.
     - **Persistence**: Implements mechanisms to maintain access even after initial exploitation.
   - Simulates a full **Red Team** operation, showcasing an advanced attacker lifecycle.

### 6. **Advanced Reporting & Insights**
   - **ReconBreach** generates comprehensive, easy-to-understand reports that include:
     - **Vulnerability Severity**: Categorized into Critical, High, Medium, and Low based on exploitability.
     - **Exploitability Analysis**: Details how easily each vulnerability can be exploited.
     - **Mitigation Recommendations**: Offers actionable advice on how to fix or mitigate each vulnerability.
   - **Reports Formats**:
     - **HTML Reports**: Ideal for sharing with stakeholders, with interactive visuals.
     - **Interactive Reports**: Real-time data visualizations, including charts and graphs for in-depth analysis.
     - **JSON Reports**: For automated parsing and integration with other tools.
