# üî• **ReconBreach** üî•
### The AI-Powered Penetration Testing Tool | *For Elite Hackers Only*

**ReconBreach** is not just a tool‚Äîit's the ultimate weapon for advanced penetration testing. Combining the latest in Artificial Intelligence and automated attack vectors, ReconBreach intelligently scans, exploits, and reports on vulnerabilities faster and smarter than ever before. Get ready to unleash the power of AI in your penetration testing arsenal.

## üöÄ **Features**

### 1. **Automated Penetration Test Flow**
   - Upload a target, and ReconBreach automatically initiates an attack sequence to test for critical vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **CSRF**, **Command Injection**, and more.
   
### 2. **Multi-Vector Attack Simulation**
   - Simultaneously conducts tests across multiple surfaces‚Äî**Web**, **Mobile**, and **Network**‚Äîfor comprehensive vulnerability discovery.

### 3. **AI-Powered Reconnaissance**
   - Deploys machine learning algorithms to intelligently **scan websites**, **APIs**, and **IoT devices**. Categorizes data like open ports, software versions, and SSL configurations, predicting the weak points of the target.

### 4. **AI-Based Payload Generation**
   - Armed with machine learning, the tool predicts the most likely vulnerabilities and generates **smart payloads** based on real-time feedback, including **SQLi**, **XSS**, **CSRF**, and more.

### 5. **Post-Exploitation**
   - ReconBreach doesn‚Äôt stop at exploitation. It goes further, attempting **privilege escalation**, **pivoting** across networks, and maintaining **persistence** to ensure control.

### 6. **Advanced Reporting**
   - Generates **in-depth reports** with vulnerability severity, exploitability, and mitigation suggestions. Get clean, understandable insights to fortify your defenses.

## ‚ö° **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Before installing **ReconBreach**, make sure your system is ready for elite hacking operations.

- **OS**: Kali Linux (or any Debian-based distro)
- **Python Version**: 3.x
- **Dependencies**:
   - Nmap
   - Metasploit Framework
   - Python Libraries

### **Installing Dependencies**

Start by installing the necessary packages and dependencies for **ReconBreach**:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip nmap metasploit-framework -y
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 tensorflow scikit-learn pandas paramiko


üõ† Usage

ReconBreach is powerful, yet simple to use. After installing the tool, you can launch it from the terminal with the following command:

python3 reconbreach.py --target <TARGET_URL>

    Reconnaissance: The tool will automatically start scanning the target for vulnerabilities.
    Payload Generation: Upon detecting weak points, ReconBreach will generate optimized payloads.
    Exploitation: It will then attempt exploitation and report any findings.
    Post-Exploitation: The tool will try to escalate privileges and maintain access.

Sample Command:

python3 reconbreach.py --target https://example.com

üß† AI Model Configuration

    Model v1: Basic vulnerability prediction model
    Model v2: Advanced exploit prediction using AI
    Model v3: Fully optimized AI model for real-time threat response

Configuration File

All configuration settings for the AI Models can be found in the config/ai_model_config.json file. You can customize the behavior of the models according to the targets you‚Äôre testing.
üîí Security & Ethics

ReconBreach is a tool designed to help security professionals and ethical hackers identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in web applications, APIs, IoT devices, and networks.

    DISCLAIMER: Unauthorized use of this tool is illegal. You must have explicit written permission to test the target system. Use responsibly and ethically.

üìä Reports

Once the penetration test is completed, ReconBreach will generate detailed and structured reports for easy reading.

    HTML Reports: View the test results in a beautiful, easy-to-read HTML format.
    Interactive Reports: Real-time data visualization using charts and graphs.
    JSON Reports: Export raw test data in JSON format for deeper analysis or automated parsing.

üìà Log Files

Logs are stored under the logs/ directory, allowing you to track the test‚Äôs progress and actions:

    Reconnaissance Logs: logs/recon_log.txt
    Exploit Logs: logs/exploit_log.txt
    Post-Exploitation Logs: logs/post_exploit_log.txt

üîß Customization & Extending

ReconBreach is built with extensibility in mind. You can easily extend its functionality:

    Add new AI models in the ai_models/ folder.
    Extend vulnerability scanners like Nikto, OpenVAS, and Nessus.
    Customize exploit payload generators in the exploit.py file.
