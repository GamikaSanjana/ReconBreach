## üöÄ **Features**

### 1. **Automated Penetration Test Workflow**
   - **ReconBreach** streamlines the penetration testing process: Simply upload a target, and the tool automatically initiates a comprehensive attack sequence to test for critical vulnerabilities such as:
     - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
     - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
     - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
     - **Command Injection**
     - **Directory Traversal**
     - **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
     - **Server Misconfigurations**
   
### 2. **Multi-Vector Attack Simulation**
   - **ReconBreach** executes parallel attacks across multiple surfaces:
     - **Web Applications**
     - **Mobile Applications (iOS, Android)**
     - **Network Infrastructure**
   - This enables comprehensive vulnerability discovery, simulating sophisticated, multi-faceted attacks to uncover hidden weak points across your entire attack surface.

### 3. **AI-Powered Reconnaissance**
   - With the power of **machine learning** and **AI**, **ReconBreach** intelligently scans the following:
     - **Websites** for open ports, services, and SSL/TLS configurations.
     - **APIs** for undocumented endpoints and security gaps.
     - **IoT Devices** for potential attack vectors.
   - It categorizes findings such as open ports, software versions, misconfigurations, and services, allowing the tool to **predict weak points** and optimize testing for the most exploitable vulnerabilities.

### 4. **AI-Based Payload Generation**
   - Using real-time intelligence, **ReconBreach** dynamically generates optimized **payloads** to exploit identified vulnerabilities:
     - Predicts likely attack vectors.
     - Generates smart payloads for **SQLi**, **XSS**, **CSRF**, and **Command Injections**.
     - Maximizes payload effectiveness based on real-time feedback from the scanning phase.

### 5. **Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement**
   - **ReconBreach** doesn‚Äôt stop at exploitation. The tool attempts:
     - **Privilege Escalation** to gain higher access levels within the compromised system.
     - **Pivoting** across the network to compromise additional systems.
     - **Persistence** mechanisms to maintain access even after the initial exploitation phase.
   - The tool simulates a complete attacker lifecycle for **Red Team** operations.

### 6. **Advanced Reporting and Insights**
   - **ReconBreach** generates highly detailed **reports** that are easy to understand and actionable:
     - **Vulnerability Severity**: Reports categorize vulnerabilities based on risk levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
     - **Exploitability**: Includes a detailed analysis of how easily each vulnerability can be exploited.
     - **Mitigation Recommendations**: Provides detailed steps to fix or mitigate each identified vulnerability.
   - Available in multiple formats:
     - **HTML Reports**: Clean, visually appealing reports for easy sharing with stakeholders.
     - **Interactive Reports**: Real-time data visualizations with charts and graphs.
     - **JSON Reports**: For deep analysis and automation.

## ‚ö° **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure your system is ready for elite penetration testing before installing **ReconBreach**.

- **Operating System**: Kali Linux (or any Debian-based distribution).
- **Python Version**: 3.x or above.
- **Required Dependencies**:
   - **Nmap** for network scanning.
   - **Metasploit Framework** for exploitation.
   - Various **Python Libraries**.

### **Installing Dependencies**

Install the required packages and dependencies for **ReconBreach**:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip nmap metasploit-framework -y
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 tensorflow scikit-learn pandas paramiko


## üõ† **Usage**

ReconBreach is powerful, yet simple to use. After installing the tool, you can launch it from the terminal with the following command:

```bash
python3 reconbreach.py --target <TARGET_URL>
```

- **Reconnaissance**: The tool will automatically start scanning the target for vulnerabilities.
- **Payload Generation**: Upon detecting weak points, ReconBreach will generate optimized payloads.
- **Exploitation**: It will then attempt exploitation and report any findings.
- **Post-Exploitation**: The tool will try to escalate privileges and maintain access.

Sample Command:

```bash
python3 reconbreach.py --target https://example.com
```

## üß† **AI Model Configuration**

- **Model v1**: Basic vulnerability prediction model
- **Model v2**: Advanced exploit prediction using AI
- **Model v3**: Fully optimized AI model for real-time threat response

### **Configuration File**

All configuration settings for the AI Models can be found in the `config/ai_model_config.json` file. You can customize the behavior of the models according to the targets you‚Äôre testing.
